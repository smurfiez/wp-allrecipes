All Recipes Scraper

Requires Yoast SEO to change titles/meta etc

Script currently caches the whole HTML page from allrecipes, eventually should change to only cache saved results.  Caching does bring about some inconsistencies especially for newer pages.  Page 1 maybe cached while page 2 is not therefore leading to some items being repeated.
